TDD follows a 3-step process:

Write a Failing Test - Understand the (user) requirements/story well enough to write a test for what you expect. (the test should fail initially - hence it being "Red")

Make the (failing) Test Pass - Write (only) the code you need to make the (failing) test pass, while ensuring your existing/previous tests all still pass (no regressions).

Refactor the code you wrote take the time to tidy up the code you wrote to make it simpler (for your future self or colleagues to understand) before you need to ship the current feature, do it.
